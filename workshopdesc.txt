[h1]Spicetrauma:Variety for the Spoken 1.0.0[/h1]
is a simple mod that adds a healthy handful of NPC conversations, mostly expanding the variety of casual banter while trying to stick to the game's general vibe.

[hr][/hr]
[h2]What exactly does this mod do?[/h2]
As of its most recent update, it adds:
[list]
[*]2 mission-start conversations
[*]8 casual conversations
[*]3 high-intensity one-liners
[*]3 high-intensity conversations
[/list]

Like other conversation mods, this overrides nothing, merely adding to the pool that NPCs can choose from with existing tags. To keep it lightweight and vanilla-friendly, it also adds no new personality types, though I might make a supplementary mod that does in the future.

Comes in both English and Latin-American Spanish, because those are the languages I speak. Offers to help translate into other languages are greatly appreciated!

[h3]All of my mods are open-source![/h3]

[h2]Is this mod compatible with X?[/h2]
This is a relatively unintrusive mod that shouldn't break anything by itself. It can be added or removed during a campaign at any time without issue.
As the changes are entirely additive rather than replacing, it also shouldn't conflict with or be overriden by other mods.

[h2]Can you add cross-mod support for X?[/h2]
How would you do this for a conversation mod?

I suppose if you'd like additional conversations that are relevant to a specific mod, consider reaching out to ask. It'll likely take the form of a supplementary compat mod.

[h2]How often does this mod update?[/h2]
As this is a very small mod, there's not much to do except keep on the lookout for bugs and cross-mod support opportunities. As such, it will only get updated when needed.

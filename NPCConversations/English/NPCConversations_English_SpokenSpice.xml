    <Conversation line="Only thing better than one Orca... is two Orcas. Or the Orca 2." speaker="1" allowedjobs="captain,medical">
      <Conversation line="I don't know what to tell you. It's simply better." speaker="1">
        <Conversation line="It trades its downsides for simply being unimpressive in comparison. Why not get any other sub?" speaker="2">

      <Conversation line="Great agility, great flood handling, great looks... what's not to like?" speaker="1">

    <Conversation line="It's a weird one, but the Herja's actually kinda nice." speaker="1" allowedjobs="security,assistant">
      <Conversation line="That type of gun coverage with only three guns is to die for." speaker="1">
        <Conversation line="Good luck dealing with boarding parties, though. That oughta suck." speaker="2">
          <Conversation line="That top railgun begs to differ." speaker="1"/>

      </Conversation>
    </Conversation>
    <Conversation line="Big operations require Big Rigs." speaker="1" allowedjobs="engineer,mechanic">
      <Conversation line="And even bigger blind spots. What sub doesn't come with a bottom gun?" speaker="2">
        <Conversation line="One that has two discharge coils and a healthy battery capacity." speaker="1">
          <Conversation line="Slap a gun down there, and she's a mighty beast." speaker="1"/>

    <Conversation line="Sit down and make way for the queen of all subs; you know the one." speaker="1"  allowedjobs="engineer,mechanic">
      <Conversation line="The Berilia might be hungry, but she's a powerhouse that demands respect." speaker="1">
        <Conversation line="Hard to respect a gigantic target with insane crew requirements." speaker="2">
          <Conversation line="Come back to me when you've successfully fought one of those things. Even while she's down, she just keeps kicking." speaker="1"/>

    <Conversation line="Remora, final answer. Agile and flexible are just my style." speaker="1" allowedjobs="captain,medical">
      <Conversation line="Don't you find the interior super awkward? Everything's all over the place." speaker="2">
        <Conversation line="It's manageable, that's all I can really say. Plus, that drone is nothing to scoff at." speaker="1">
          <Conversation line="Helps with covering the undefended underside until you can get some extra firepower. Then you have yourself a free mobile gun." speaker="1"/>

      </Conversation>
    </Conversation>
    <Conversation line="You know, the Typhon was so good that they actually made a second one." speaker="1" allowedjobs="security,assistant">
      <Conversation line="Most guns out of any sub, and electric defenses just for good measure." speaker="1">
        <Conversation line="Still not much better in the speed department, though. Can't really shoot things if you can't catch em." speaker="2">
          <Conversation line="Just make sure they can't run away in the first place." speaker="1"/>

    <Conversation line="Say what you want, the Kastrull does work." speaker="1" allowedjobs="security,assistant">
      <Conversation line="Unless you poke a hole in it, that is." speaker="2">
        <Conversation line="I'd like to see anything try. This thing has so many weapons it's not even funny." speaker="1">
          <Conversation line="Oh, and its drone with a frontal gun, too. A little extra overkill, as a treat." speaker="1"/>

    <Conversation line="I feel like it goes without saying; the Winterhalter is in a class of its own." speaker="1" allowedjobs="captain,medical">
      <Conversation line="You'd be correct if you meant that in terms of energy demands." speaker="2">
        <Conversation line="It tries to be everything, and fails to be practical." speaker="2">
          <Conversation line="What's that thing people say? Master of none, but sometimes better than a master of one?" speaker="1"/>
